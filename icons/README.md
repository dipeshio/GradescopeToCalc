# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in PNG format:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Requirements

- **Format**: PNG
- **Background**: Transparent preferred
- **Style**: Simple, recognizable design
- **Theme**: Calendar/school related (e.g., calendar with graduation cap, books with calendar, etc.)

## Suggested Design Elements

- Calendar icon with Gradescope "G" or graduation cap
- Books with a calendar overlay
- Assignment/homework icon with calendar dates
- Simple, clean design that works at small sizes

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using:
- Online tools like Canva, Figma, or Sketch
- Image editing software like GIMP, Photoshop, or Illustrator
- Icon generators specifically for Chrome extensions

## Temporary Solution

Until custom icons are created, you can use simple colored squares or find free icons from:
- Google Material Design Icons
- Font Awesome icons
- Feather icons
- Heroicons

## Note

The extension will still work without custom icons, but Chrome will show default placeholder icons instead.
